# Hash Calculator

Hash Calculator is a Python script that calculates the SHA-256 hash value of a file. It provides a simple and efficient way to verify file integrity and ensure data consistency.

## Features

- Calculates the SHA-256 hash value of a file
- Supports command-line usage for easy integration into workflows
- Provides informative error messages for file not found or unreadable files

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the following command to calculate the SHA-256 hash of a file:

   ```shell
   python hash_calculator.py <file_path>
   ```

   Replace `<file_path>` with the path to the file you want to calculate the hash for.

   For example, to calculate the hash of a file named `file.txt`, located in the same directory as the script, run:

   ```shell
   python hash_calculator.py file.txt
   ```

5. The script will calculate the SHA-256 hash value of the file and display the result in the terminal.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system before running the script.
